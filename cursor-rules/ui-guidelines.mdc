## Spacing & Density

- Sections should flow tightly‚Äîno excessive top/bottom padding between components.

## Button Styling

- Use flat or subtly raised styles; avoid thick shadows or gradients.

## Layout & Grid Rules

- All content must sit within a `max-width: 900px` container, centered horizontally.
- Use `grid` or `flexbox` to arrange content in 2‚Äì4 column structures when possible.
- Do not stack full-width sections without clear separation.

## Design Philosophy

This application is intended to be a **professional, internal tool**‚Äînot a marketing site. Visual design should:
- Prioritize clarity, space efficiency, and usability.
- Avoid playful, flashy, or overly accessible styles.
- Feel is internal SaaS dashboards used by developers or analysts.

## Visual Refinement Guidelines

### üì¶ Cards and Sections

- All major content areas (e.g. Resources, Notifications, Metrics) must be placed inside visual containers.
- Each card/section must include:
  - Optional light shadow: `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`
  - Rounded corners: `border-radius: 8px`
  - Use background `#ffffff` or slightly off-white (`#fafafa`) to distinguish sections
- Avoid heavy, dark borders. Use:
    - Light borders: `#eaeaea` or `#f0f0f0`
    - Or substitute with a subtle shadow: `box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04)`
- Increase border-radius to `8px` for all cards and major controls to soften the visual tone.

### üß± Tables and Data Blocks

- Use borders or alternating row backgrounds for visual separation
- Do not collapse cells together‚Äîensure whitespace exists between content blocks

### üñ≤Ô∏è Controls and Inputs

- All controls (e.g., dropdowns, buttons, text inputs) must:
  - Include hover states for interactivity (`border-color`, `shadow`, or background tint)
  - Avoid overly flat or invisible UI elements

### Background Color Policy

- Avoid green, blue, or tinted section backgrounds.
- All primary containers and page backgrounds must be pure white: `#ffffff`.
- Use very light gray (`#f9f9f9`) for subtle highlights (e.g. table row hover, inactive states).

### üî≤ Visual Hierarchy

- Group related information inside visually distinct blocks
- Use card structure or background shading to separate unrelated content
- Avoid leaving components floating without visual framing

### Color Usage for Status and Alerts

Introduce color with intent and hierarchy:

- **Success**: Green (`#198754`) ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù
- **Warning**: Amber (`#f0ad4e`) ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúPending‚Äù, ‚ÄúScheduled‚Äù, ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù
- **Danger**: Red (`#dc3545`) ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúFailed‚Äù, ‚ÄúError‚Äù
- **Neutral**: Blue or Gray (`#6c757d`, `#0d6efd`) ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù, ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù
- Use for:
  - Status pills
  - Timeline activity icons
  - Alerts and notifications
  - Contextual tags or indicators

These rules ensure a polished, breathable UI even under high layout density constraints.
