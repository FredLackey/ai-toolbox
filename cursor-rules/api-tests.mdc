- APIs are tested using the VSCode RestClient extension
- One *.http file is created for each major route function
- Only success tests are created (happy path)
- The API tests folder is /tests under the project root folder and mirrors the structure of the route path
- The API_HOST_URL is stored within the project's .env file and is loaded when the tests are run.
