- All routes must be completely documented within an OpenAPI spec document before creating or modifying any route handler
- Route handlers are writen and exposed as a function.  Example: 

  const fetchItems = (req, res) => {
    const data = [];
    return res.json(data); 
  }

- The Express Router object may only exist in an index.js file.
- The index.js file defines the routes and exposes the route handlers.
- All route handlers should have a single validate(req) function and return either a single error string or null.
